#### Abstract
The invariant speed c (the speed of light in vacuum) is central to modern physics. This hypothesis proposes that c is best understood as an information‑processing limit of reality: the maximum rate at which the universe can coherently perform the sequential information updates that produce a single, shared classical world. Building on finite information capacity (Bekenstein bound), quantum speed limits (Margolus–Levitin / Lloyd), and causal microstructure (CDT, causal sets), I introduce the "Cosmic Firewall" model: relativistic effects are an emergent global safety protocol that prevents an observer or subsystem from synchronizing with the universal update clock and thereby collapsing sequential order into an "ontological singularity".

#### 1. Motivation: the "why" question
While special and general relativity establish c as a kinematic bound, they do not by themselves answer why the universe imposes such a universal cap. The hypothesis reframes the question: to maintain a single, coherent classical reality arising from quantum possibilities, the universe must execute sequential updates at a finite rate. Finite information capacity + finite update rate → maximum propagation velocity.

#### 2. Core postulational framework
- Postulate 1 — Finite information capacity: bounded regions have a finite maximal information content (Bekenstein).
- Postulate 2 — Finite update rate: quantum systems have upper bounds on distinct state transitions per second (e.g., Margolus–Levitin).
- Postulate 3 — Sequential reduction as time: macroscopic time corresponds to ordered sequences of information updates (decoherence/reduction events).
- Postulate 4 — Firewall safety protocol: the set of constraints (time dilation, asymptotic limits) prevents local subsystems from synchronizing with the universal sequencing clock; this is the Cosmic Firewall.

#### 3. Conceptual consequence: the ontological singularity
An observer who could synchronize with the universal update rate would lose sequential access to frames and perceive multiple classical configurations simultaneously — destroying causal order. Physics must thus prevent such synchrony; relativity's asymptotic approach to c is interpreted here as that prevention.

#### 4. Formalization strategy
Two parallel routes are proposed:
- Route A (information‑bounds algebra): combine Margolus–Levitin bounds with Bekenstein information limits to produce per‑bit update rates that scale with c/R and show how propagation speed emerges.
- Route B (causal microstructure simulations): adopt discrete causal building blocks with finite information and constrained update clocks, simulate different update rules, and measure emergent causal cones and speed scales.

A worked toy derivation and a short technical note live in `formalization/technical_note.md`.

#### 5. Compatibility and constraints
Any rigorous version must address Lorentz invariance: show how the invariant speed emerges or is recovered asymptotically. The hypothesis is intended to be compatible with existing physics; its novelty is explanatory – giving an information‑theoretic reason for c.

#### 6. Testability and falsifiability
Candidate tests:
- Derive a quantitative inequality linking local information density, energy, and effective signal speed and check against observational bounds.
- Demonstrate in toy microstructure models whether Lorentz symmetry and a single invariant speed robustly emerge.
- Predict and search for semiclassical signatures under extreme information density; null results constrain parameter choices.

#### 7. Open questions
- Can the exact value of c be derived (not only scaling)?  
- How does Lorentz invariance concretely emerge?  
- Which interpretations of quantum mechanics are compatible or incompatible with the sequential reduction picture?

#### 8. Next steps
- Formalize Route A algebraically (technical note in this repo).  
- Build and publish Route B toy simulations.  
- Seek targeted reviews from quantum information and causal‑structure researchers.
