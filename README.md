#### TL;DR
The hypothesis reframes c as the maximum rate at which the universe can coherently perform sequential information updates that produce one classical world. Finite information density (Bekenstein bound) plus quantum speed limits (e.g., Margolus–Levitin) and causal microstructure (CDT / causal sets) together require a throttling protocol — the Cosmic Firewall — which manifests as relativistic constraints (time dilation, invariant light cones).

#### What this repo contains
- `hypothesis.md` — the main hypothesis (English, structured, with formalization plan).
- `formalization/technical_note.md` — a short technical note and toy derivation (Route A) that sketches how bounds scale and why c appears as a characteristic speed.
- `references.bib` and `references.md` — starter bibliography.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md`, `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`, `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` — workflow and review structure.
- `LICENSE` — CC BY 4.0.

#### Important notes
- This is conceptual and theoretical. There are no laboratory or construction protocols in this repository.
