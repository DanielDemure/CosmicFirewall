Short announcement blurb for social media:

I published an open, WIP hypothesis "Cosmic Firewall" that reframes c as an information-processing limit. Repo: https://github.com/DanielDemure/CosmicFirewall

Highlights:
- Conceptual synthesis linking Bekenstein bound, quantum speed limits, and causal microstructure.
- Toy calculations and simulation sketch included.
- CC BY 4.0 license; contributions welcome.
